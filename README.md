#A simple Electron wrapper around Lime Go

Built with [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier)

```bash
$ npm install && npm run build 
```

to build the apps. If building on a macOS, you will need Wine on your machine to build the Win32 version.

`brew install wine`

If building on a Windows machine... ehh... just comment out the parts of the code trying to build the Mac version
